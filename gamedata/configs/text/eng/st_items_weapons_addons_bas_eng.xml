In common use since 1964 when it was introduced as a standard issue telescopic sight for SVD sniper rifle. The scope has been later adapted to assault rifles such as AK-74 or AN-94. Recognized for its durability, versatility and very well-designed reticule pattern featuring convenient range-finder scale. This particular type has 4.0x magnification rate, making it usable mainly for combat at long ranges. It is attached to weapons by means of a dovetail mount, which is standard in Warsaw Pact countries.\n \n

		The SpecterDR 4x/1x Dual Role Optical Sight represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world’s first truly dual field of view combat optical sight, the SpecterDR switches instantly from a 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight with the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes.
Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN’S legendary crystal clear image.
The SpecterDR 4x/1x offers the best single solution for both Medium Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use. (The scope has back up iron sights on top of it).

		<text>Docter as a brand was born in 1991, but the company started writing its story much earlier. It was previously called Carl Zeiss Jena. In the 1980s, this was one of the largest optics manufacturing companies in the world. They started operating more than 100 years ago and built an impeccable reputation throughout the years. After World War II, the company started growing rapidly and bloomed until East and West Germany merged in 1991. This was when the first major change happened – the company was taken over by Bernhard Docter. Shockingly, the company bankrupted. Analytic Jena Group bought Docter in 1997, and the company started growing again. In 2018, a change in administration occurred. The company was renamed from Docter to Noblex. Most of the products remained in the offer but Noblex added some new ones as well. They retained the famous logo – the owl.
 Throughout the years, Docter has been known to offer high-quality Made-in-Germany products for an affordable price. Because of that, the company gathered plenty of followers, loyal to the brand. Since 2018, when Noblex took over, the company expanded their manufacturing processes elsewhere.</text>

As it was technologically more advanced as well as lighter, the Russian military has chosen it over the PSO-3 as the standard optic for the SV-98. We offer an AA version with linearly marked elevation turrets, exclusively imported by Kalinka Optics It fits AK and SVD rifles and is optimized for use on SVD, Tigr, PSL Mosin and similar rifles. It's fully coated prismatic lens system provides a remarkable, high contrast, wide angle field of view and lower eyepiece location for comfortable aiming. The scope has an illuminated rangefinding reticle. The scope has POSP-style windage and elevation adjustments (every elevation turret' click moves POI by 4.5 cm at 100 m, every windage turret' click moves POI by 2.5 cm at 100 m). The special protective lens coatings protect the scope from scratching and fouling in the extreme battlefield conditions where it was designed to operate. Notice the extreme temperature rating on this scope, you'll quit before it will. It comes with a cover case and rubber eyepiece. A definite BEST CHOICE!.</text>

	<string id="st_addon_scope_ekp8_18_descr">
		<text>Kobra Military 8-18 Red Dot Weaver Rifle Scope, Screw Mount. The world famous Kobra is an open collimator "red dot" combat optic using laser-generated "heads-up display" (HUD) technology to superimpose a reticle pattern onto a filtered lens which acts as an aiming device for the shooter. This system presents an unobstructed field of view, in 1x power which allows for extremely comfortable, "both eyes open" shooting. On average, most users will see a 1.5 times faster target acquisition and a 50% smaller shot group at 100 meters, in comparison to the iron sights. It is designed for engaging fast moving targets and targets appearing for a short period of time in close quarters and urban combat situations in various light conditions. It provides clear targeting from 104 lx to 10-2 lx (daylight, twilight and moonlight), one- or two-eye targeting, is very effective when shooting from moving vehicles, and allows for perfect kill shots on fast-moving, small and spontaneously appearing targets.</text>

Its incredibly wide field-of-view and crystal-clear glass dominates the competition, while its rugged aluminum housing and steel sheath ensure it will perform in the harshest conditions. Ease-of-use was also a focus when designing this elite red dot sight, which is why we put an easy access battery compartment on top and gave it click-adjustments for more precision. And this isn’t just a pistol sight either; the DP Pro is just as at home on AR’s, shotguns, and pretty much anything else that goes bang.</text>
